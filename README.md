# Boston_House_Price_Prediction

This data science project on real estate price prediction website. We will first build a model using sklearn and linear regression using boston house prices dataset. Second step would be to write a python flask server that uses the saved model to serve http requests. Third component is the website built in html. During model building covered almost all data science concepts such as data load and cleaning, standard scaling and normalizing, feature engineering. Technology and tools wise this project covers,

1. Python
2. Numpy and Pandas for data cleaning
3. Matplotlib for data visualization
4. Sklearn for model building
5. Jupyter notebook, visual studio code and pycharm as IDE
6. Python flask for http server
7. HTML for UI
8. Heroku platform for deployment using dockers
